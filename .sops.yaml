# Call these "master keys", they can access the secrets
# specified below (authorized users/hosts)

# Note that this only applies on creation of new secrets, so if
# you add a key here and try to access a past secret without that
# new key it might error.
# Use 'sops updatekeys <file>' to manually fix this using
# a master that was already on the list

# Remember that sops only deals in GPG or AGE keys, it won't
# automatically convert your SSH keys for you. So you're basically
# mimicking your SSH key setup but converted into AGE keys for sops.

# Keep in mind that sometimes your keys will need to be at $HOME\.config\sops\age\keys.txt
# TALOS = Converted its SSH host key at /etc/ssh to an age key at .config/sops/age/keys.txt
# Also used that same SSH host key (or its public key) to generate the public age key to put in this file

# 1. Install ssh-to-age
  # go install github.com/Mic92/ssh-to-age/cmd/ssh-to-age@latest
  # nix-shell -p sops-to-age
   
# 2. Create an private age key from a private SSH key and stow it at .config/sops/age
  # ssh-to-age -private-key -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o $HOME\AppData\Roaming\sops\age\keys.txt
  # ssh-to-age -private-key -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o $HOME/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
  
# 2. Create a public age key from an SSH public key
  # cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519.pub | ssh-to-age
  # ssh-to-age -private-key -i /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key -o $HOME\.config\sops\age\keys.txt
# Get remote host key (public)
  # ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 192.168.0.6 | ssh-to-age
  
# other host keys at /etc/ssh
